# Summer Heat Waves Mobile Alert System - Vijayawada

## Project Overview

This repository contains the data analysis and prototype machine learning model for a **Summer Heat Waves Mobile Alert System** designed for the city of Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. With the increasing risks posed by extreme heat events due to climate change, this project aims to create a system that can predict the likelihood of a heatwave and provide timely, actionable alerts to the public.

This project covers the complete data science lifecycle, from initial data exploration to the development of a deployable predictive model and the architectural design for a full-scale mobile alert platform.

## Methodology & Project Phases

The project was executed in three main phases:

1.  **Data Analysis & Exploration:** A historical weather dataset for Vijayawada was acquired, cleaned, and analyzed. The key insight from this phase was the critical impact of humidity, making the **"Feels Like" temperature** a more important metric for public health than the actual temperature.

2.  **Predictive Model Development:** Using the cleaned data, a machine learning model was developed to predict the daily `alert_level` based on historical weather patterns. The alert levels are defined as:
    * **Normal:** "Feels Like" temperature below 40째C.
    * **Heatwave (Orange Alert):** "Feels Like" temperature between 40째C and 44.9째C.
    * **Severe Heatwave (Red Alert):** "Feels Like" temperature is 45째C or higher.

3.  **System Architecture Design:** A high-level blueprint was designed for a production system to integrate the model with mobile platforms for widespread dissemination of alerts via Push Notifications and SMS.

## Dataset

* **Source:** The dataset was sourced from [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/), providing daily historical weather data for Vijayawada from September 2024 to September 2025.
* **Filename:** `Vijayawada24_25.csv`
* **Key Features Used:** `datetime`, `tempmax`, `tempmin`, `temp`, `feelslikemax`, `feelslike`, `humidity`, `solarradiation`, and `uvindex`.

## Model Performance (Tuned Prototype)

A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained to predict the daily alert level. To optimize performance, **Hyperparameter Tuning** was conducted using `GridSearchCV` to find the best combination of model settings. The final tuned model was then evaluated on a test set (20% of the data) that it had never seen before.

* **Final Tuned Accuracy:** **75.34%**
* **Best Settings Found:** `{'class_weight': None, 'max_depth': 10, 'min_samples_leaf': 2, 'n_estimators': 200}`
* **Key Finding:** The model performs well in predicting "Normal" and "Heatwave" days. However, the analysis revealed a key challenge with **class imbalance**; the model still struggled to predict the rare but most critical "Severe Heatwave" events, achieving a recall of only 25% for that category.
* **Conclusion:** The prototype successfully proves the viability of the concept. Future work must focus on techniques to improve the model's performance on rare, high-risk events, such as using different class weighting strategies or gathering more years of data.

## Proposed System Architecture

The end-to-end system is designed to be fully automated and cloud-based:

1.  **Backend:** A Python script deployed on a cloud server (e.g., AWS Lambda) runs daily. It fetches the latest weather data, feeds it to our trained model, and gets a prediction.
2.  **Dissemination:** If a "Heatwave" or "Severe Heatwave" is predicted, the backend triggers alerts through:
    * **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for mobile app push notifications.
    * An **SMS Gateway** (e.g., Twilio) for text message alerts.
3.  **Frontend:** A simple, lightweight mobile app for Android and iOS that displays the current alert status, provides safety tips, and shows a map of public cooling centers.

## Technologies Used

* **Data Analysis:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Joblib
* **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code, Conda
* **Collaboration:** Git & GitHub

## How to Use This Repository

To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/HiteshPolavarapu/Heatwave-Alert-System.git](https://github.com/HiteshPolavarapu/Heatwave-Alert-System.git)
    cd Heatwave-Alert-System
    ```
2.  **Set up the Conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create --name heatwave_env python=3.11
    conda activate heatwave_env
    conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter joblib -c conda-forge
    ```
3.  **Run the analysis script:**
    Ensure the `Vijayawada24_25.csv` file is in the same directory. Run the main script from your terminal. The script will generate plots (you will need to close each plot window to proceed) and save the final model files.
    ```bash
    python run_analysis.py
    ```
